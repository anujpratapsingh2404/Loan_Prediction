🏦 Loan Prediction Project

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved 
or not based on various applicant details such as income, loan amount, 
credit history, and more. It’s a binary classification problem widely used to 
demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques in machine learning.

🧠 Project Overview

The Loan Prediction problem aims to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer details provided by applicants. 
The objective is to predict whether an applicant’s loan should be approved (Yes) or not (No) 
using data such as income, gender, marital status, employment type, and credit history.
